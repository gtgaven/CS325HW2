<h2>Endless MSPaint</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A sidescroller which players acquire points for being in the right position on the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
have a fun time with hardly any sort of time investment.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
2D sidescroller/platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Simple movement and sprite animation as well as a partial 3D background effect.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Powerups that enhance movement (to be implemented later), give the player several different ways to solve time constrainted puzzles. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
casual gamers of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
~5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
since you can move backwards faster than forwards, players will most likely utilize that to their advantage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All visual assets were made from scratch using MSPaint and Photoshop.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Mario...?
</li>
